# Space Shooter with UniRx

This is a game made from this Unity tutorial:

https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial

I rewrote all the scripts from the tutorial using Unity Reactive Extensions:

https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx

In addition to original scripts I also made them more granular, so that every script has only single responsibility and contain a single aspect or behaviour of the game object. All the good stuff is in `/Assets/Scripts/`.
